Intro
Aim
we aim to explore the possiblitiiyes in informing a chase-cam process using computer visoin.
	We proved that it's totally feasible.   In fact, our object tracker is almost SLAM. It's great, it even makes radio beacons better, and can work without them.
We used a hex platform passed down from previous groups and tried to leave it better than we found it.
	Now it's WAY better than we found it.

This is a good place (1.1) to state the aims and objectives and summarize the great work and ground-breaking outcomes (blow your trumpet) - before getting into deeper discussion of the motivation and background. Briefly explain and highlight the significance of the Object Tracker work. 
Either make Motivation a separate chapter (recommended), or include Background (1.3) in the Intro.

    We have greatly improved the capabilities of the UWA autonomous hexacopter platform, and have brought the code-base up to a level where it is feasible to implement rudimentary SLAM processes.
    We have also demonstrated that low-power single board computers can perform live computer vision processes and rudimentary SLAM processes with uncertainty based reasoning to track and follow moving objects.
    Our Computer-Vision-Only routines are by no means as robust as radio links and differential GPS, but the use of Computer Vision allows aesthetic framing of more than a wrist-worn GPS beacon.
    Our Object tracker has been demonstrated with a variety of navigation loops, some of which are not GPS dependent.  In commodity chase-cams, these control schemes could allow a graceful handover from radio beacon to computer vision in the event of a GPS failure.
